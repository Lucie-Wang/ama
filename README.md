# AMA by Lucie 
<p> A repository to ask 
  
[@lucie-wang](github.com/lucie-wang) anything!</p>
<p> My friends always find me inspiring in different aspects of life. I went to 4 universities in 3 different countires (China, France, US) during my undergraduate. I have worked as a French Adjunct Instructor, Software Trainer, Project Manager, Software Engineer and Yoga Teacher. I have passion for languages, art, dance, technology and food (check out #cuisinebylucie on Instagram)! I have also been helping new grads with career planning and interview preps. If you have a question you are interested in reading me tap out a response for, this is just the joint for you.

# Ask a question
<p>
Asking a question is as easy as 
  
  [creating a new issue](https://github.com/Lucie-Wang/ama/issues/new) on this project.
</p>

<p>
I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer, I will close the issue just so I know it has been answered (with a sense of complishment!). Don't worry, if you have any further questions, just repond in the same thread and I will get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any issue that may have been created by others:)
